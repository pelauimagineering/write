Right turns on red have become so normalized in North American driving culture that most people don't question them. But cities around the world are reconsidering this practice.

## The Problem

Drivers turning right on red often fail to:
- Look for pedestrians crossing the street
- Notice cyclists in bike lanes
- Yield to oncoming traffic from the left

This creates a dangerous environment, particularly for vulnerable road users.

## What Cities Are Doing

Several major cities have begun restricting or eliminating right turns on red:

- **New York City** has prohibited right on red in most of Manhattan
- **Washington, D.C.** has added restrictions at high-pedestrian intersections
- **San Francisco** is piloting no-right-on-red at dangerous intersections

## The Evidence

Studies show that intersections where right on red is prohibited see:
- 20% fewer pedestrian injuries
- Improved crossing safety for people with disabilities
- Better compliance with traffic signals overall

It's time to reconsider this practice in more cities.
